# Web-Project-3---Musician Project
Notown Records has decided to store information about musicians who perform on its albums (as well as other company data) in a database. The company has wisely chosen to hire you as a system designer.
1. Each musician that records at Notown has an SSN, a name, an address, and a phone number. Poorly paid musicians often share the same address, and no address has more than one phone.
2. Each instrument used in songs recorded at Notown has a unique identification number, a name (e.g., guitar, synthesizer, flute) and a musical key (e.g., C, B-flat, E-flat).
3. Each album recorded on the Notown label has a unique identification number, a title, a copyright date, a format (e.g., CD or MC), and an album identifier.
4. Each song recorded at Notown has a title and an author.
5. Each musician may play several instruments, and a given instrument may be played by several musicians.
6. Each album has a number of songs on it, but no song may appear on more than one album.
7. Each song is performed by one or more musicians, and a musician may perform a number of songs.
8. Each album has exactly one musician who acts as its producer. A musician may produce several albums, of course.

Tasks
1. Create a diagram of what the models and relationships look like, use contoso for an example. Post that to Eliot, Tucker and myself we will review and advise before you get too far into the project
2. Create all models, controllers and views
3. Verify that when creating, editing or deleting a record everything is cleaned up.

This is going to be a little bit challenging but you have learned everything you need to know you will just need to syntesize it all.
